## 🚀 Core Functionalities

### 1. Alpha Generation & Simulation Automation

- Generates alpha expressions using predefined alpha templates.
- Searches WorldQuant datafields based on customizable search conditions.
- Automatically submits simulations to the WorldQuant Brain backend.
- Detects session timeouts and performs automatic re-login to ensure uninterrupted execution.

---

### 2. Result Filtering & Variation Testing

- Filters simulation results according to configurable performance criteria.
- Extracts promising alpha expressions from qualified results.
- Systematically generates variations by modifying simulation settings or operators.
- Re-runs simulations to evaluate robustness and performance improvements.

---

### 3. Automated Submission & Documentation

- Scans filtered results to identify alphas that meet submission standards.
- Automatically submits eligible alphas to the platform.
- Organizes submitted alphas into structured Markdown documentation for tracking, review, and portfolio management.
